BitBath
=======

BitBath is a programming game: pit your army of bots against your enemy. Strategy and tactics will crush the weak.

The homepage for bitbath is http://www.hacker.org/bitbath/

Code Layout
-----------

The core codebase lies in Engine/. This has the basic game logic, the UI's, etc.

In hackjvm/ we find the JVM that executes bot matches in a controlled environment. This is based on the OJVM written by Omar Sabry, and is written entirely in Java.

The directory hackjvm/rt/ hosts the Java classes that form the core library bots are allowed to execute (things like String, HashMap, etc).

The root bitbath/ directory contains files used to build the standard SDK end-users can download from the website.

Dependencies
------------

To run the 3-D version of Bit
Bath, you must install jMonkeyEngine, an open-source 3-D engine written in Java. Make sure you get version 2.0, which is available on SVN from Google Code.
