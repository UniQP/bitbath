The virtual machine and its runtime data areas.

The package includes *containers* that hold the data manipulated by
the JVM. The package does not deal with the interpretation of the
data.

The internal structure of the machine is not exposed. A facade object
acts as an observer. Code in other packages only interacts with the
machine through the facade.
